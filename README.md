# The ORC License Text in Markdown Format
The  file, ORC_license_text.md, contains the text of the Open RPG Creative License ("ORC License") in Markdown format. 
The purpose of having such is to include as a LICENSE.md file in Github repositories for games developed and released 
under the ORC License's terms. 

Note that the publications themselves do not need to include the ORC license text in its entirity. Only a reference 
and attribution statement, as described within the license terms. Note that the license text is itself held under 
Copyright by Azora Law. They have granted permission for use of the license in the fashion summarized above and 
detailed within the license terms. See [azoralaw.com/orclicense/](https://azoralaw.com/orclicense/) for details.

(NOTE: While the above addresses legal matters, is it not Legal Advice, merely a layperson's summary. If you have
questions about using the ORC license, see the Answers and Explanations document published by Azora at the link
above and consider consulting with an Attorney.)
